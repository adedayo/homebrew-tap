  # There is deliberately no *versioned* `depends_on macos:` stanza. Homebrew
  # 6.0.22 *disabled* `depends_on macos: :catalina` outright — "There is no
  # replacement" — and the string form `">= :catalina"` before it. Declaring
  # either is now a hard error that makes the cask uninstallable, which is how
  # it reached a user: `brew install --cask adedayo/tap/checkmate-app` aborted
  # with "Calling `depends_on macos: :catalina` is disabled!".
  #
  # Nothing is lost by dropping the version. The stanza only ever produced a
  # nicer message on macOS versions older than Catalina; the .dmg is a
  # universal 64-bit bundle those releases could not run regardless, and
  # Homebrew itself no longer supports them.
  #
  # The unversioned form below is still supported, and is required: `brew
  # style` flags a cask with a macOS-only artifact that omits it.
  depends_on :macos

  # CheckMate.app, matching outputfilename in wails.json. The previous value
  # was "checkmate-app.app", which no build has ever produced — the cask would
  # have failed to link on install.
  app "CheckMate.app"

  # CheckMate is ad-hoc signed, not notarised — see docs/distribution.md for why
  # we decline to pay Apple to give free software away. Homebrew has already
  # done the thing notarisation is a proxy for: it verified the download against
  # the sha256 above before we got here. Clearing the quarantine flag on that
  # verified bundle is therefore not a weakening of the install; it just stops
  # Gatekeeper re-asking a question Homebrew answered with better evidence.
  #
  # Scoped to this bundle only. Nothing here touches system-wide policy, which
  # is why it is `-dr ... CheckMate.app` and not `xattr -cr` on anything wider.
  #
  # This runs in `postflight`, against the installed bundle, and not in
  # `preflight` against "#{staged_path}/CheckMate.app" — the previous form,
  # which did nothing observable. Homebrew propagates the quarantine attribute
  # from the downloaded .dmg onto the app as part of *installing* the artifact,
  # which happens after preflight has run. Clearing the flag on the staged copy
  # therefore cleared a flag that was about to be re-applied, and users who
  # installed with the cask still had to run xattr by hand.
  #
  # `postflight_steps` and not `postflight`: the arbitrary-Ruby `postflight`
  # block is deprecated in Homebrew 6 and slated for the same removal that just
  # turned `depends_on macos:` into an error. `postflight_steps` is the
  # declarative replacement — a list of vetted operations that Homebrew can run
  # inside a sandbox, rather than a block of tap-supplied code.
  #
  # `{{appdir}}` is a template token expanded by Homebrew at install time; it
  # cannot be written as `#{appdir}` here because the steps block is evaluated
  # before any cask paths exist.
  #
  # `must_succeed: false` because a bundle carrying no such attribute — a
  # future notarised build, or a re-run of this block — must not turn a
  # successful install into a failed one.
