  # have failed to link on install.
  app "CheckMate.app"

  # CheckMate is ad-hoc signed, not notarised — see docs/distribution.md for why
  # we decline to pay Apple to give free software away. Homebrew has already
  # done the thing notarisation is a proxy for: it verified the download against
  # the sha256 above before we got here. Clearing the quarantine flag on that
  # verified bundle is therefore not a weakening of the install; it just stops
  # Gatekeeper re-asking a question Homebrew answered with better evidence.
  #
  # Scoped to this bundle only. Nothing here touches system-wide policy, which
  # is why it is `-dr ... CheckMate.app` and not `xattr -cr` on anything wider.
  #
  # This runs in `postflight`, against the installed bundle, and not in
  # `preflight` against "#{staged_path}/CheckMate.app" — the previous form,
  # which did nothing observable. Homebrew propagates the quarantine attribute
  # from the downloaded .dmg onto the app as part of *installing* the artifact,
  # which happens after preflight has run. Clearing the flag on the staged copy
  # therefore cleared a flag that was about to be re-applied, and users who
  # installed with the cask still had to run xattr by hand.
  #
  # `system_command` and not `system_command!`: a bundle carrying no such
  # attribute — a future notarised build, or a re-run of this block — must not
  # turn a successful install into a failed one.
